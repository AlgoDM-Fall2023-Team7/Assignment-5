# Fashion Image Annotation Database

## Overview

This project utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision to text API to automate the annotation of fashion product images for a fashion retailer. The annotations are stored in a Snowflake database, creating a comprehensive database of image tags for future use.

## Tasks

### 1. Tag Generation

Analyzing navigation bars of leading fashion websites, we've identified crucial tags for fashion product images. The provided annotations include:
- Type of Image
- Gender
- Sleeves
- Collar
- Formal or Informal
- Color
- Age Group
- Brand Name
- Other Info

### 2. JSON Template

The JSON template has been adjusted to align with the provided annotations, ensuring consistency and compatibility with the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API.

```json
{
  "image_path": "s3://your_bucket/image.jpg",
  "annotations": {
    "type_of_image": "",
    "gender": "",
    "sleeves": "",
    "collar": "",
    "formal_informal": "",
    "color": "",
    "age_group": "",
    "brand_name": "",
    "other_info": ""
  }
}
```

### 3. Prompt for ChatGPT

A prompt has been formulated to interact with ChatGPT for generating JSON data based on image content. This prompt ensures seamless integration with the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API.

```
Given an image of a fashion product, provide annotations for:
1. Type of Image:
2. Gender:
3. Sleeves:
4. Collar:
5. Formal or Informal:
6. Color:
7. Age Group:
8. Brand Name:
9. Other Info:
```

### 4. Pipeline/Automation Script

The automation script performs the following steps:
- Iterates through each image in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API to generate annotations based on the formulated prompt.
- Performs a bulk upsert operation into the Snowflake database, creating a comprehensive image annotation database.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have access to the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API and Snowflake credentials.
2. Modify the JSON template with your S3 bucket information.
3. Run the pipeline/automation script to annotate images and populate the Snowflake database.
